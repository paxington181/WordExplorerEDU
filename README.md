# WordExplorerEDU


Word Explorer was written in Python 3, intended for educational purposes only.  Word Explorer comes with a simple default word list with definitions in the file wordlist.txt.  If you wish to edit that list, you can either use the built in list editor or edit the plain text file in any text editor that can open .txt files.  Making additions through Word Explorer is more user friendly for the formatting of the word and dictionary entry pairs.
