# WordExplorerEDU


Word Explorer was written in Python 3, intended for educational purposes only.  Word Explorer comes with a simple default word list with definitions in the file wordlist.txt.  If you wish to edit that list, you can either use the built in list editor or edit the plain text file in any text editor that can open .txt files.  Making additions through the List Editor is more user friendly for the formatting of the word and dictionary entry pairs.

If at any point you find the word list is not reading properly due to an error in saving or editing, please delete the file and open Word Explorer again.  It will generate a new wordlist.txt with the defaults that came with the original.

If you encounter any errors, have any questions, or wish to see the source code, please go to (edit this once the GitHub is created for this project, still personal for now).
